# DSBPB-config
Personalized configuration files for Discord Sidebar Price Bot (written by pipercucu - https://github.com/pipercucu/DiscordSidebarPriceBot). Hosting on GitHub simply allows me to easily push changes to several config files by simply "wget"ing this repo after I've uploaded to Git (makes things easy with a headless Raspberry Pi).
